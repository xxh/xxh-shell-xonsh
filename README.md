## Notes

### Using python, pip and [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html)

The xxh is using pip and python from `xonsh.AppImage` by default. You can update pip (`pip install --upgrade pip`) and install packages ordinally: `pip install --upgrade pandas`. The packages will appear in host xxh home `~/.xxh/pip` by default.

To install [xontribs](https://xon.sh/xontribs.html) in xxh session use `xpip install <package>`. Never use `pip` to install xontribs ([details](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3463)).
